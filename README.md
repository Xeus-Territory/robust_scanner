To launch a successful Reflected XSS attack, an adversary looks for places where user-input is used directly in the generation of a response. This often involves elements that are not expected to host scripts such as image tags (<img>), or the addition of event attibutes such as onload and onmouseover. These elements are often not subject to the same input validation, output encoding, and other content filtering and checking routines."

In a widely used web application this is not a major problem because 1 in a 1,000 is good enough in a widely used application. A common first step for an attacker is to footprint the environment to understand what attacks will work. Since footprinting relies on enumeration, the conversational pattern of rapid, multiple requests and responses that are typical in Ajax applications enable an attacker to look for many vulnerabilities, well-known ports, network locations and so on."

## Step by Step to install robust_scanner
1.  Clone the repository
2.  Install ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) with the [GUI Version](https://www.zaproxy.org/) or reference the repository for information [GitHub](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy)
3.  Create a new .env file for configuration settings such as ZAP proxy API Key - Open it on the API tab on ZAP GUI<br>
    Ex: `ZAP_API_KEY='xxxxxxxxx'`
4. Create `scans.json` to store the results of ZAP scan
5.  Install all required for project from requirements.txt with the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Need to install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) before)
6.  Run this tool with the following command: `python api.py` or `python robustScan.py`

Note: Docker version can be released on soon as it will be available

## Note:
1. Take a private your ZAP API key
2. Configure for Proxy can be locally or Proxy on Remote Server like VPS ==> `default Proxy using : locahost:8080`
3. Make issue if you meet any problems on the process using one
4. You can help me improve this project by DM me :coffee:. Hopefully contribution from your ideas
